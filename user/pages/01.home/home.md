belowcontent: "<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1cdkvha900\">Need a Fast Medical License?</h2>\r\n<p>If you need a Medical License Fast and it doesn't matter where then consider the following States:</p>\r\n<h5># 1 - Indiana Medical Board</h5>\r\n<p>The Indiana Medical Board can issue a Temporary License in 2 weeks given that everything falls into place. Indiana has limited certification requirements which allows for an expedited process. The verifications which are required are limited to the NPDB-HIPDB report, Med School Transcripts, Exam Scores, and State License verficiations. Most licenses with Indiana are issued between 1 1/2 to 3 months.</p>\r\n<h5># 2 - Michigan Medical Board</h5>\r\n<p>The Michigan Medical Board is the only State with True Reciprocity. If a Physician has held an active License in the USA for at least 10 years, then the only verifications which are required are State License Certifications. Most licenses with Michigan are issued within 1 1/2 months to 3 months. If a Physician hasn't held a license for 10 years then the Physician's Medical School, State Licenses, and Board Scores have to be sent to the Indiana.</p>\r\n<h5># 3 - New York Medical Board</h5>\r\n<p>For Domestic Graduates, New York is one of the fastest States in the USA. Why? New York does not verify Employment, Privileges, Malpractice, or Medical Licenses. Because we only have to verify the physician's Med School, Training Hospitals, and Exam Scores. The process typically is complete and NY Med Licenses are issued between 1 1/2 to 3 months. The internal mail system with New York runs between 2-4 weeks. International Graduates can have a much longer licensure time frame due to the mandated FCVS Requirement for IMG's.</p>"
